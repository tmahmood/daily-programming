# daily-programming
Spending 1 hour to write some program, anything. Will upload even it's not completed.

* Keep it simple, It can be web, terminal based app, or even simple games. But avoid complex programs
* Should be able to complete in an hour
* Must include something new
* After an hour I will upload it to GitHub
* Will start fresh. 
	* No reuse, 
	* No continuation of previous projects
* If the project is interesting enough, I can promote it to a full blown project
